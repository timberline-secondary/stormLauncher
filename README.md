# Instructions

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04

### Setup

This will create a python virtual environment and install dependancies to it, so the launch script works

`bash setup.sh`

### Run it

`sudo bash launch.sh`



# Storm Launcher

Controls the Dream Cheeky [O.I.C Storm](http://www.dreamcheeky.com/storm-oic-missile-launcher) & [Thunder](http://www.dreamcheeky.com/thunder-missile-launcher) USB Missile Launchers.  

There are a few projects for using older launchers in Linux, but I couldn't find any for this launcher, so... enjoy.
    
It also requires that you run it as root unless you want to spend an afternoon playing with udev rules :/

## Usage:

* Use arrow keys aim.
* Press return to fire.
